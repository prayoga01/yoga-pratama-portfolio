        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Overview</h2>
        <p class="mb-8 text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          Early detection of breast cancer is developed to increase public awareness of preventive activities such as SADARI (Breast Self-Examination) every month. Breast cancer screening supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology
          using the Naive Bayes algorithm provides an intelligent solution to identify potential risks at an early stage quickly and efficiently, thereby enhancing awareness and improving opportunities for timely treatment. This project
          integrates several technologies, including Laravel as the web framework for application development, Tailwind CSS for building a responsive and modern interface, and Spring Boot as the backend service connected with the Weka
          machine learning library to perform Naive Bayes classification for breast cancer risk prediction. Additionally, Postman is used for testing and validating RESTful APIs to ensure system reliability. Through the integration of these
          tools, the project offers a comprehensive platform that combines preventive healthcare awareness with AI-driven diagnostic support, empowering individuals to conduct regular self-examinations while leveraging intelligent screening
          to strengthen early intervention strategies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Main Objectives</h2>
        <p class="mb-8 text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
          This project is expected to assist healthcare professionals in providing education on self-conducted early detection, enabling patients and the community to predict health risks more easily. In addition, the system provides
          appropriate first aid information and supports more effective care planning, thereby improving the quality of prevention, early treatment, and the overall success of healthcare strategies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="mb-8 text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">The project employed Agile Software Development, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and incremental delivery. The methodology involved several phases:</p>

            Users who select either the condition “Still Menstruating” or “Post-Menopause” and then click the button to begin filling out the signs and symptoms form will go through a restriction mechanism as part of the prediction flow.
            This mechanism serves as an initial filter to guide the input process but does not affect the final prediction generated by the system. Therefore, the user’s selection of hormonal conditions, whether during the menstrual cycle
            or post-menopause, does not alter the accuracy of the prediction provided.

            and symptoms, which are then compared with the training dataset previously analyzed using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). The trained model is saved in .model format and integrated into the system. This
