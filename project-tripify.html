          <li class="mb-2">
            <b>User flow login:</b> The login user flow in Tripify illustrates the step-by-step process for both existing and new users. It begins with the welcome screen, where users can choose to log in or register. Existing users proceed
            directly by entering their credentials, while new users are guided through registration and account verification via email. Once verified or logged in, all users are directed to the home/dashboard, gaining full access to the
            app’s features. This flow ensures a smooth, efficient, and user-friendly access experience.

          <li class="mb-2">
            <b>Create itinerary:</b> The create itinerary user flow in Tripify describes how users build and manage their travel plans. The process starts with selecting a destination search, followed by creating an itinerary that includes
            travel dates, companions, and budget. The system then generates a recommended plan, which users can review and confirm to save under “My Trip.” After saving, users are given the option to invite collaborators (friends or family)
            to co-edit the itinerary. Finally, the saved plans are accessible in My Trip, where users can view, edit, or delete them. This flow ensures flexibility, personalization, and collaborative planning for a better travel experience.
          </li>
          <img src="src/img/UI/tripify/Create itinerary.png" alt="Tripify Project Preview" class="rounded-lg w-full mb-8 shadow" />
          <li class="mb-2">
            <b>Enhance Travel Experience:</b>The view maps user flow in Tripify outlines how users explore detailed location information. It begins when a user selects or searches for a destination, leading to the destination page with
            general info such as images and descriptions. From there, users can access the detail destination section, which provides deeper insights including history, culture, attractions, and recommendations (restaurants, accommodations,
            activities). By choosing the maps option, users can view the destination’s location directly on the map. The process concludes with users returning to the previous page or the app’s home screen. This flow ensures easy navigation
            and contextual insights for travel planning.

            it easier for users to plan their trips effectively.
